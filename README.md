# Air-Quality-Prediction-
This project will help to predict whether the air quality in a city is satisfactory. 

# Description
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on environmental and atmospheric data. Air pollution is a critical global issue, and accurate AQI prediction can help individuals, organizations, and governments take preventive measures to protect public health.

The objective of this project is to analyze historical air quality data, perform data preprocessing, and develop a predictive model capable of estimating AQI values using various machine learning algorithms. The model utilizes features such as pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3), temperature, humidity, and other relevant environmental parameters.

Key steps involved in the project include:

Data collection from reliable air quality datasets

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization

Feature selection and engineering

Model training using regression algorithms

Performance evaluation and optimization

Comparison of multiple machine learning models

The final system aims to provide accurate AQI predictions that can be used for real-time monitoring and decision-making. This project demonstrates practical application of data science techniques such as regression modeling, data visualization, and performance analysis.

Technologies used in this project include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook.
